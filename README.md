## Technical Details

### Data Storage

The Power-Up uses Trello's built-in data storage system:
- Data is stored per card using `t.set()` and `t.get()`
- Storage scope: `'shared'` (visible to all board members)
- Storage key: `'timeTracker'`

### Data Structure

Each card's time data is stored as:
```javascript
{
  totalTime: 3600,           // Total seconds tracked
  isTracking: false,         // Whether timer is currently running
  startTime: null,           // Timestamp when current session started
  entries: [                 // Array of time entries
    {
      date: "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
      duration: 1800,        // Entry duration in seconds
      type: "timer",         // "timer" or "manual"
      description: "..."     // Optional description for manual entries
    }
  ]
}
```

### Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Requires HTTPS for Trello Power-Up integration
- Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit `styles.css` to modify the color scheme:
- Primary blue: `#0079bf`
- Success green: `#00c851`
- Danger red: `#b04632`

### Adding Features

The modular structure makes it easy to add features:
1. Add new capabilities in `js/client.js`
2. Create corresponding HTML interfaces
3. Update the capabilities list in the Power-Up admin

### Modifying Time Formats

Update the `parseTimeInput()` function in both `js/client.js` and `time-tracker.html` to support additional time formats.

## Troubleshooting

### Power-Up Not Loading

- Ensure browser isn't blocking the updates
- Try refreshing the Trello page

### Data Not Saving
